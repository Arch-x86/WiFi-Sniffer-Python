# INTRODUCTION
## WiFi Sniffer
A python-based tool to sniff the packet transmitting over the network. 

##  ⚠ Ethical Disclamer
This project is developed strictly for educational and research purposes. It is intended to demonstrate how network packet analysis works and to help understand network security concepts.

The author does not encourage or support unauthorized access, interception, or monitoring of network traffic. This tool should only be used on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

Misuse of this software may violate local, national, or international laws.

## learning objective
1.Understand how packet sniffing works at the network layer
2.Learn how monitor mode operates in wireless adapters
3.Explore how protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS transmit data
4.Understand ethical considerations in network security testing
