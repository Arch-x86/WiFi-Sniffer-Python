# Wifi Sniffer Tool
## Overview
A python-based tool to sniff the packet transmitting over the network.
 
> [!WARNING]
> This project is developed strictly for educational and research purposes. It is intended to demonstrate how network packet analysis works and to help understand network security concepts.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand how packet sniffing works at the network layer
- Learn how monitor mode operates in wireless adapters
- Explore how protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS transmit data
- Understand ethical considerations in network security testing
- Practice building GUI-based networking tools using Python and Tkinter
